 ACCORDING TO Fraser
The adaptive search process is as follows:
	-Perform a neighbor search over the whole domain for the first cycle. This involves
	- Finding the bounds of the simulation
 Determining the number of cells in each dimension
 Binning particles into their cells

Searching for neighbors
 Calculate conservation of mass, momentum, material models, external forces, etc
 The effective plastic strain increment is determined based on the material model
 Build a list of elements with an effective plastic strain (𝛥𝜀𝑝) that surpasses a threshold,
adapt_thresh. This is done by:
 Cycle through the elements, if an elements 𝛥𝜀𝑝 is greater than adapt_thresh place the
element id in a list called AdaptSearchList
 Mark the element in another array called AdaptNode, this array can be used to show which
elements are adapted in the post-processor
 Increment a counter (nNodeAdaptSearch) to keep track of how many elements are in the
AdaptSearchList. On the GPU, we use an atomicinc() function to prevent incorrect
incrementation of nNodeAdaptSearch.
 Pass nNodeAdaptSearch and AdaptSearchList to the cell search subroutine. The search is performed
only for the nodes in the AdaptSearchList
 The neighbors are updated
 The smoothing function values are updated
 The neighbor list and smoothing function values are kept and re-used for the SPH elements that
are not on the AdaptSearchList
The AdaptNode array is used to visualize which elements are processed in the adaptive search. This is
an important consideration to ensure that the field of elements adapted is not overly discontinuous
