The schedule(static, chunk-size) clause of the loop construct specifies that the for loop has the static scheduling type. 
OpenMP divides the iterations into chunks of size chunk-size and it distributes the chunks to threads in a circular order.
When no chunk-size is specified, OpenMP divides iterations into chunks that are approximately equal in size and it distributes at most one chunk to each thread.

Here are three examples of static scheduling.
