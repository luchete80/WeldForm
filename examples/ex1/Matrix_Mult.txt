Matrix-matrix-multiplication using transpose of this.

The optional parameter adding determines, whether the result is stored in C or added to C.

if (adding) C += AT*B

if (!adding) C = AT*B

Assumes that A and B have compatible sizes and that C already has the right size.

This function uses the BLAS function Xgemm if the product of the three matrix 
dimensions is larger than 300 and BLAS was detected during configuration. Using BLAS usually results in considerable performance gains.
