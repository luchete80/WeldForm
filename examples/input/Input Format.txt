cflMethod (int): CFL method used for adaptive time stepping.

0: No adaptive time stepping
1: Use CFL condition
2: Use CFL condition and consider number of pressure solver iterations

cflFactor (float): Factor to scale the CFL time step size.
cflMinTimeStepSize (float): Min. allowed time step size.
cflMaxTimeStepSize (float): Max. allowed time step size.
