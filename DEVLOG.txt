20220509 - Working on SOA version. Same solver response for thermal.
20220510 - Working on FSW example. Working on Thermal SOA version.
            Working on FSW example. Working on Thermal SOA version.
              Checking Johnson Cook Traction example. 
20220511 - FSW Example. Setting contact = true. Checking normals and min initial contact gap.
20220511  - 	FSW Example. Setting contact = true. Checking normals and min initial contact gap.
              Begining to add Mat3_t to flat conversions (to test soon SOA vs AOS).
20220512  -   Working on flat arrays, using Particle class. Next step is to compare with 
              Still not working. Fixed FSW example velocity.
              Working on contact Mesh update, now the update changes normals and centroids.
              Changed JC material to FSW example.
              Fixed thermal coupling. 
20220513  -   Working on FSW example. timestep 5e-8 diverging. So, now is 2.e-8, fixed.
              INITIAL GAP WAS WRONG. Fixed. 
20220519  -   Working on Compression TRIP problem. Manual TS with CFL values of 0.2 NOT CONVERGING.
              Found an error in Particles Move, ghost particles where moving BEFORE adjusting ghost velocity.
              and acceleration were not forced to zero. MoveGhost is now also fixing accel to zero.
20220520  -   Symm TRIP problem still does not work. Begining to add arrays for parallel sum (reduction)
              instead of using particle lock (slow).
20220523  -   Numerical integration. Qpplied dep/2 in Modiried verlet algorithm.
              Verlet is FAR FASTER than leapfrog. 
              XSPH. Found an ERROR (XSPH was not applied on leapfrog). 
              But not seeing results.
              RANDLES-LIBERSY 1996: Main loop updating variables order. 
              Begining to change this, alsp like fraser. Apparently allows to CFL up to 1.5
20220524  -   Working on New order update Solver. Not working.
              ERROR found in verlet, added a new kick-drift verlet-leapfrog integrator
              Error found at XSPH in leapfrog.
              Working on #271. For THE FIRST TIME IS CONVERGING WITH A CFL LARGER THAN Modified >Verlet
              A kick-drift based solver updating on different times.
              Still wrong at displacements and velocities, but not in accelerations.
              THIS SHOULD BE DONE ALSO WITH MOD VERLET IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE EVEN BETTER TIME STEP
              FIRST SOLVER FASTER THAN MODIFIED VERLET. 
              Succesful "Differential order kick-drift solver. Can solve TRIP benchmark with CFL 0.4 
              whereas mod verlet runs at 0.2 and greater is diverging.
20220525  -   Added mod euler Differential update like Kirk Fraser method.
              It also converges at cfl 0.4 but results are strange 
20220526  -   Added different untegral algortithms, all with Added MoveGhost to KickDrift.
              Added plastic deformation Neghbour update, NOW WORKING PLASTIC.
              Contact WORKING on kick-drift algorithm. Fraser compression test works ok up until 5ms.
              Then diverges. 
20220530  -   Working on Internal and Kinetic Energy. 
------------------------------------------------------
20220601  -   Found ERROR in ghost symmetry at high strains. Velocities are extremely high. (#280)
              Begining to work on allowance of more than 1 contact surface.
20220602  -  Working on 2 surface contact. DONE. WORKING OK.
             Should be corrected:
               -  Contact forces still uneven
               -  Autoadjust initial gap. 
             Added bonded contact type.
20220607  -  Added SEO contact algorithm (which looks for penetration only and not velocity direction).
             Added displacement constraint to double side contact TRIP example. 
             Found error in ID assignment of KickDrift Solver.
             Changed TRIP example to be Symmetric in Length Axis 
             Implemented higher Artif. Visc. constants on TRIP example. 
             Added XSPH on new KickDrift Solver.
20220610  -  Added some calculation time logs to KickDrift solver. 
             Begining to add a algebraic (non discrete) surface contact algorithm for calc time reduction.
20220614  -  Begining to add Full Implicit SPH.
             Add fixes in top and bottom for 2 side compression TRIP test 
20220616  -  Fixed Internal Energy calculation.
             KickDrift Solver now calculates all material models. (Strange results in Johnson Cook).
20220621  -  Solved Finally uneven contact forces, second contact algorithm seems to be even.
             FIRST CASE WITH STATIC FRICTION WORKS. Issue #275 closed.
20220622  -  Added auto time stepping to KickDrift solver.
20220623  -  Added plastic plateau to Hollomon material.
20220624  -  Added SAE 1010 Compression example. 
             Fixed hardening for Hollomon and Johnson Cook for KickDrift Integrator
             Begining to Work with generic executable input file reader.
             This should be priority, adding and compiling each example is nonsense.
20220626  -  Working with new parallel reduction without particle locking
20220627  -  Working with new parallel reduction without particle locking, flattening arrays.
             ATTENTION: ARRAYS COULD BE DIMENSIONED BY NProc
20220628  -  Fixed error in new reduction algorithm. 
             Working on Input. Added symmetry case.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20220704  -  Working on Input file, contact cases
20220705  -  Begining to add wang and Zhan static friction coeff criteria
             IMPORTANT. Velocity criteria is not working well.
             Try to do wag ceiteria as seo but with dist in future time: i.e. 
             Instead of xi for dist, use xi+v*dt
20220706  -  First satisfactory results in contact problem with generic friction.
             A mixed algorithm based on Wang for contact force and Zhan for
             tangential force comparison (velocity rates), comparing with 
             current velocity, leads to an acceptable algorithm.
20220707  -  Working on Contact. Found that displacement tg force criteria 
             (Wang2013) reduces displacements for same friction coeff
20220708  -  Working on reduction.FINALLY SOLVED NISHIKURA REDUCTION IN ACCEL.
             TIME IS ABOUT HALF THE TIME WITH OPENMP LOCK REDUCING IN PAIR PHASE.
             Written reduction in tensors. Resultant tensors are the same but whole results 
             Are still bad. 
20220712  -  SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS. 1. FINALLY IMPLEMENTATION OF LEAPFROG SOLVER WORKS ON 
             LARGE TIME STEPS. 2. SOLVED PARALLEL REDUCTION BY NISHIMURA ARRAYS. Is slightly
             faster than lock but the algorithm is applicable to parallel GPU.
20220713  -  FIXED GHOST PARTICLE METHOD. Equallying ghost stress, strain and density from 
             respective particles, is working. Now remains to make Wang's hybrid 
             contact-ghost symmetry method.
20220714  -  Working with CONTACT. New Leapfrog Algorithm gives Smooth Contact Forces
             with SEO Algorithm (CalcForces2), but static friction does not work.
             On the other side, original KickDFrift Solver (without second acc update cycle)
             gives smooth forces with Wang algorithm.
             MUST FIX Original KickDrift and check also with Verlet and Fraser. 
20220715  -  FIRST FRASER ALGORITHM WORKING. REINFORCED BCs before position update works.
             ALSO WORKS WITH CFL 0.7
