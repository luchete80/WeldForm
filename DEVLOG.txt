20220509 - Woeking on SOA version. Same solver response for thermal.
20220510 - Working on FSW example. Working on Thermal SOA version.
            Working on FSW example. Working on Thermal SOA version.
              Checking Johnson Cook Traction example. 
20220511 - FSW Example. Setting contact = true. Checking normals and min initial contact gap.
20220511  - 	FSW Example. Setting contact = true. Checking normals and min initial contact gap.
              Begining to add Mat3_t to flat conversions (to test soon SOA vs AOS).
20220512  -   Working on flat arrays, using Particle class. Next step is to compare with 
              Still not working. Fixed FSW example velocity.
              Working on contact Mesh update, now the update changes normals and centroids.
              Changed JC material to FSW example.
              Fixed thermal coupling. 
20220513  -   Working on FSW example. timestep 5e-8 diverging. So, now is 2.e-8, fixed.
              INITIAL GAP WAS WRONG. Fixed. 
20220519  -   Working on Compression TRIP problem. Manual TS with CFL values of 0.2 NOT CONVERGING.
              Found an error in Particles Move, ghost particles where moving BEFORE adjusting ghost velocity.
              and acceleration were not forced to zero. MoveGhost is now also fixing accel to zero.
20220520  -   Symm TRIP problem still does not work. Begining to add arrays for parallel sum (reduction)
              instead of using particle lock (slow).
20220523  -   Numerical integration. Qpplied dep/2 in Modiried verlet algorithm.
              Verlet is FAR FASTER than leapfrog. 
              XSPH. Found an ERROR (XSPH was not applied on leapfrog). 
              But not seeing results.
              RANDLES-LIBERSY 1996: Main loop updating variables order. 
              Begining to change this, alsp like fraser. Apparently allows to CFL up to 1.5
