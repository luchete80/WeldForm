20220509 - Working on SOA version. Same solver response for thermal.
20220510 - Working on FSW example. Working on Thermal SOA version.
            Working on FSW example. Working on Thermal SOA version.
              Checking Johnson Cook Traction example. 
20220511 - FSW Example. Setting contact = true. Checking normals and min initial contact gap.
20220511  - 	FSW Example. Setting contact = true. Checking normals and min initial contact gap.
              Begining to add Mat3_t to flat conversions (to test soon SOA vs AOS).
20220512  -   Working on flat arrays, using Particle class. Next step is to compare with 
              Still not working. Fixed FSW example velocity.
              Working on contact Mesh update, now the update changes normals and centroids.
              Changed JC material to FSW example.
              Fixed thermal coupling. 
20220513  -   Working on FSW example. timestep 5e-8 diverging. So, now is 2.e-8, fixed.
              INITIAL GAP WAS WRONG. Fixed. 
20220519  -   Working on Compression TRIP problem. Manual TS with CFL values of 0.2 NOT CONVERGING.
              Found an error in Particles Move, ghost particles where moving BEFORE adjusting ghost velocity.
              and acceleration were not forced to zero. MoveGhost is now also fixing accel to zero.
20220520  -   Symm TRIP problem still does not work. Begining to add arrays for parallel sum (reduction)
              instead of using particle lock (slow).
20220523  -   Numerical integration. Qpplied dep/2 in Modiried verlet algorithm.
              Verlet is FAR FASTER than leapfrog. 
              XSPH. Found an ERROR (XSPH was not applied on leapfrog). 
              But not seeing results.
              RANDLES-LIBERSY 1996: Main loop updating variables order. 
              Begining to change this, alsp like fraser. Apparently allows to CFL up to 1.5
20220524  -   Working on New order update Solver. Not working.
              ERROR found in verlet, added a new kick-drift verlet-leapfrog integrator
              Error found at XSPH in leapfrog.
              Working on #271. For THE FIRST TIME IS CONVERGING WITH A CFL LARGER THAN Modified >Verlet
              A kick-drift based solver updating on different times.
              Still wrong at displacements and velocities, but not in accelerations.
              THIS SHOULD BE DONE ALSO WITH MOD VERLET IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE EVEN BETTER TIME STEP
              FIRST SOLVER FASTER THAN MODIFIED VERLET. 
              Succesful "Differential order kick-drift solver. Can solve TRIP benchmark with CFL 0.4 
              whereas mod verlet runs at 0.2 and greater is diverging.
20220525  -   Added mod euler Differential update like Kirk Fraser method.
              It also converges at cfl 0.4 but results are strange 
20220526  -   Added different untegral algortithms, all with Added MoveGhost to KickDrift.
              Added plastic deformation Neghbour update, NOW WORKING PLASTIC.
              Contact WORKING on kick-drift algorithm. Fraser compression test works ok up until 5ms.
              Then diverges. 
20220530  -   Working on Internal and Kinetic Energy. 
------------------------------------------------------
20220601  -   Found ERROR in ghost symmetry at high strains. Velocities are extremely high. (#280)
              Begining to work on allowance of more than 1 contact surface.
20220602  -  Working on 2 surface contact. DONE. WORKING OK.
             Should be corrected:
               -  Contact forces still uneven
               -  Autoadjust initial gap.
